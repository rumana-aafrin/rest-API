## Overview
This project is a front-end implementation of a REST Countries API with a color theme switcher, aimed at displaying country data and allowing users to filter and search for specific countries. The challenge involved integrating with the REST Countries API to pull country data and rendering it according to provided designs.

## Technologies Used
• Semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, Flexbox, and CSS Grid for layout and styling
• JavaScript for dynamic functionality, including toggling between light and dark color themes, filtering and searching countries, and displaying detailed country information

## What I Learned
• Enhanced understanding of consuming APIs and dynamically rendering data using JavaScript
• Proficiency in managing state and user interactions, as well as implementing responsive design techniques

## Continued Development
• Improve accessibility features and enhance user experience with smoother transitions and animations
• Explore additional features such as user authentication and saving favorite countries
• Refactor the codebase to improve maintainability and scalability
